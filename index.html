							<p><i>“Excellence is the gradual result of always striving to do better.”</i></p><br />
                            <p>Established in 1964 as the School of Paper Technology, the Saharanpur campus of IIT Roorkee has come a long way in the fifty years of its existence and has succeeded in establishing its identity as an institution of excellence. This has been made possible by the relentless effort of every individual who has been a part of this campus for the last fifty years. Pravaah is a celebration which commemorates these fifty years and honours every big and small effort that has been put in making this institution progress, develop and reach greater heights.</p>
							<p>Pravaah would comprise a myriad of events spread over one year. These would include technical events like workshops and guest lectures from eminent people in the industry, an alumni meet that would bring back the years for the distinguished alumni of this campus, a socio-cultural event and  international conferences to boost research and industry-institute relations. Such events would generate great fervour, inculcate a spirit of celebration within the campus populace as well as provide the students an invaluable opportunity to interact with some of the most established individuals in the technical field.</p>
							<p>Pravaah is an expression of continuous flow of technical and creative knowledge from this campus in the last glorious fifty years.</p>

							<p>The Saharanpur Campus, which has now become an integral part of Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee, started out as the first institution in India to impart higher level education in Paper Technology. It was established as the School of Paper Technology, in the year 1964, with a tripartite agreement between Government of India, the Government of Uttar Pradesh and the Royal Swedish Government. While the Government of Uttar Pradesh and India provided funds for the allocation of the land and the construction of buildings respectively, Swedish Government, on the other hand, contributed to the providing of laboratory, equipment and technical expertise for starting the institute.</p>
							<p>The institute started with a three year Post Metric (Certificate) and two year post B.Sc. (Diploma) courses in Paper Technology with the objective of providing supervisor level 1 and management level manpower respectively, required by the upcoming and expanding paper industry in India. With the objective of achieving high academic standards, active faculty exchange programmes were undertaken with a Swedish institute in Markeryd, Sweden, that was also engaged in the impartation of similar kind of education.</p>
							<p>Its progress was quick, right from its early days. In 1968 the School of Paper Technology was renamed as the Institute of Paper Technology, a name in line with of other names of the similar in country.</p>
							<p>With development in technology and the growing need for trained personnel, with the boom in the industrial sector in our country, a need was felt for introduction of a course in process instrumentation, which was introduced as a Post B.Sc.(Diploma) program in 1977, marking the milestone for the expansion of the Institute, beyond its beginnings in the Paper Technology.</p>

								<p>The growing prosperity and intellect of the institute was witnessed all around, and the institute was merged with University of Roorkee in 1978 as its second campus. A new programme, B.E. (Pulp and Paper) was started and ongoing Diploma courses were renamed as University Diplomas. Gradually, the PhD Programs were introduced. The University of Roorkee recognised University Diplomas as equivalent to M.Sc. Degree. Finally, the Certificate courses were put an end to in the year 1982, as the BE and PhD programs gained momentum. The year 1989 saw an introduction of the ME course in Paper Technology.</p>
								<p>In the year 2001, the University of Roorkee, was converted into Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee(IITR). Simultaneously, the Institute of Paper Technology was renamed as the Saharanpur campus of IIT Roorkee with Department of paper technology as one of the academic departments of IIT Roorkee. The University Diploma courses were henceforth discontinued.</p>
								
</p>
							</div>
							<div class="right">
								<p>An academic restructuring took place in 2004 with the objective of developing Saharanpur campus as multidepartment campus with increased student and faculty strength and hence, infrastructural facilities. As an outcome of this restructuring, two new programmes namely- (i) Integrated M.Tech. Polymer Science and Technology (ii) Integrated Dual degree in B.Tech.  Process Engineering with MBA.</p>
								<p>With the development of the Polymer industry both abroad and in India, the institute stuck with its tradition of being one of the pioneers in the introduction of a course in a new discipline and started an integrated Master of Technology course in the year 2006 in Polymer Science and Technology.
								The IDD B.Tech in Process Engineering with MBA course was enhanced to keep up with the demands of the corporate sector, being integrated with a Masters in Business Administration (Integrated Dual Degree) in the year 2007.</p>

								<p>In 2013, the Department of Paper Technology was trifurcated, into the Department of Paper Technology, the Department of Polymer and Process Engineering, and the Department of Applied Sciences & Engineering.</p>

							<span id="further">FURTHER CONTRIBUTION</span>
							<ul>
								<li>Throughout its evolution from the School of Paper Technology to the present campus with multiple academic departments, the Saharanpur Campus of IIT Roorkee has made significant contributions in the Technological realm. </li> 
							
								<li>The Saharanpur Campus of IIT Roorkee played an important role in the formation of The Central Pulp & Paper Research Institute (CPPRI), Saharanpur. The United Nations’ Development Program assigned two R&D projects – one for the study of potential of Indian hardwoods for mechanical pulping and another for chemical pulping. The mechanical pulping pilot plant was setup at the Cellulose & Paper division of the Forest Research Institute (FRI), Dehradun and the chemical pulping project was taken up at Saharanpur taking advantage of the close proximity of the then Institute of Paper Technology. To foster collaboration between these two projects, an exclusive research institute (CPPRI) was set up in Saharanpur adjacent to the Saharanpur Campus of IIT Roorkee.</li>

								<li>Now, the Saharanpur Campus of IIT Roorkee enjoys a unique location having a national R&D institute in the field of pulp and paper (CPPRI) on one side and a large integrated pulp and paper mill on the other side of the campus. The students of paper technology derive immense benefit from the Star Paper Mills through in plant training and various inputs in their project works. IIT Roorkee and CPPRI have entered into a memorandum of understanding (MOU) for sharing their technical expertise and laboratory facilities.</li>

								<li>Another outcome of this unique location is that a number of manufacturers of paper mill plant & machinery and laboratory equipment have come up in and around Saharanpur.</li>
								
								<li>The Saharanpur Campus of IIT Roorkee has played active role in important policy decisions for the development of pulp and paper industry in India.</li>
								
								<li>The Saharanpur Campus of IIT Roorkee has worked in close cooperation with the Indian paper industry. For many years, an advisory committee consisting of top ranking officers of the Indian paper industry provided valuable inputs in conducting academic and research programmes at the campus.</li>
								
								<li>The institute has had considerable international influence as well, assisting in setting up training and exchange programmes for students from other countries such as Thailand and Tanzania, helping them progress in its perennial tide of excellence.</li>
